This project was an assignment for ECON306: Data Analysis for Economics and Business at the University of Delaware. The first part of the assignment was an analysis of 'Neighborhoods Matter: Assessing the Evidence for Place Effects', an article written by Eric Chyn and Lawrence F. Katz. This article is attached in .pdf form in this repository, and it is titled 'ECON306 Article to Analyze.pdf'. 

The second part of this analysis was to analyze a data set in STATA to see if there were key relationships between an individual's background and their economic outcomes later in life. The data set was collected from opportunityatlas.org, and it was cleaned and provided by Professor Tom Eisenberg. The full .do file can be found within this repository. 

The full report can be found in both .pdf and .docx form in the 'report' folder. As mentioned in the report, the STATA code was run through the Apporto Cloud Mounter from the University of Delaware's Lerner Desktop. In order to run the code in VSCode, STATA first must be installed on the device. Next, a VSCode extension (many work) is needed. Finally, the path and version of STATA need to be correct.
